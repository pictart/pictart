<p>So i decided to pick the brains of instyle china contributing editor and influencer leaf greener on the rules for dressing for the event. This year, the specialists encourage us to be brave and to dare welcome the new chinese year of metal rat in the most vibrant and intense way. Beginning on the second new moon, after the winter solstice, and ending on the full moon fifteen days later, chinese new year is a chinese festival that marks the beginning of the new year. Celebrate and rejoice for making into another year. Pin by 一 只超 on 刘诗诗 in 2020 (With images).</p>
