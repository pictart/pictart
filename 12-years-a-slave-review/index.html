<p>Steve mcqueen blew me away with this film and if i had seen this in 2013 no doubt would it had been hard to choose between this and gravity. �steve mcqueen forces us to confront the brutality of slavery� mcqueen confronts what few filmmakers have been prepared to address. In the antebellum united states, solomon northup, a free black man from upstate new york, is abducted and sold into slavery. What a beautiful film 12 years a slave is. Out of the Furnace AFI Fest Review Christian bale.</p>
