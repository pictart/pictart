<p>Most hindu festivals calendar include significant fasting days along with festivals. Holidays based on the hindu calendar include maha shivaratri, holi, guru purnima, ganesh chaturthi, and diwali. In contrast, in regions such as kerala, the solar cycle is emphasized and this is called the malayalam calendar, their new year starts in autumn, and these have origins in the second half of the 1st millennium ce. For telugu people like us the hindu new year is called as yugādi. Diwali is celebrated as the new year day in the Hindu.</p>
